\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{} In section 2, we introduce some notations and definitions used in this paper. In section 3, we present Sch\"{o}ning's original randomized algorithm\cite{Schoning99} for $\SAT$. In section 4, a derandomization algorithm based on local search by \cite{Dantsin02} is given. In section 5, we present an improvement by \cite{Moser11} that builds on the derandomization algorithm whose performance is arbitrarily close to the randomized version, thereby claiming a full derandomization.

\section{Preliminaries}
\paragraph{} An input instance of a $\SAT$ problem is a $\CNF$(Conjunctive Normal Form) formula $F$ with $n$ variables. $F$ contains a finite set of clauses where each clause $C$ contains at most $3$ pairwise independent literals. A literal $u$ is either a variable $x$ or a complemented variable $\bar{x}$. Let $V$ denote the set of variables in $F$. \par 
A truth assignment $\alpha: V\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ assigns each variable a boolean value. If a literal $u = x$, it is satisfied by $\alpha$ iff $\alpha(x) = 1$. If $u = \bar{x}$, it is satisfied by $\alpha$ iff $\alpha(x) = 0$. A clause $C$ is satisfied by $\alpha$ if at least one of its literals are satisfied by $\alpha$. A formula $F$ is satisfied by $\alpha$ if all clauses are satisfied by $\alpha$. \par 
Given two assignment $\alpha$ and $\beta$, the hamming distance between them $\dist{\alpha}{\beta}$ is defined to be the number of variables $x \in V$ where $\alpha(x) \neq \beta(x)$. A Hamming Ball centered at $\alpha$ with radius $r$ is defined to be $\ball{r}{\alpha} = \{\beta: \dist{\alpha}{\beta} \leq r\}$ that is, all assignments whose hamming distance from $\alpha$ is less or equals to $r$. \par 
\begin{definition}[Promise-Ball-\SAT\cite{Moser11}]
	An instance of the Promise-Ball-$\SAT$ problem $(F,\alpha,r)$ consists of a $\CNF$ formula $F$, an assignment $\alpha$ for $F$ and a natural number $r$. With the promise that the Hamming Ball $\ball{r}{\alpha}$ contains a satisfying assignment for $F$. Find any satisfying assignment.
\end{definition}
The Promise-Ball-$\SAT$ problem is an important sub-problem for solving $\SAT$. 

\section{Sch\"{o}ning's $3$-SAT Algorithm\cite{Schoning99}}
The randomized algorithm for $\SAT$ builds on a simple random walk algorithm. \par

	\DontPrintSemicolon
	\SetKwInOut{Input}{Input}\SetKwInOut{Output}{Output}
	\Input{A $\CNF$ formula $F$ with $n$ variables}
	\Output{A satisfying assignment $\astar$ or NO if no $\astar$ are found}
	\BlankLine
	Initialization: Choose an assignment $\alpha$ for $F$ uniformly at random\\
	\For{steps = 1 to 3n}{
		\lIf{$\alpha$ satisfies $F$}{return $\alpha$}
		Choose an arbitrary clause $C$ not satified by $\alpha$\\
		Choose a literal in $C$ uniformly at random and flip its value in $\alpha$
	}
	\lIf{$\alpha$ satisfies $F$}{return $\alpha$}
	\hspace{7em}\lElse{return NO}
\end{algorithm}
\paragraph{Analysis} Fix a satisfying assignment $\astar$, for the random initial assignment $\alpha$, $\Pr(\dist{\astar}{\alpha}=r) = {n \choose r}2^{-n}$ . Let $q_r$ be the probability that $\SAT$-Random-Walk returns a satisfying assignment for $F$ given $\dist{\astar}{\alpha} = r$. Notice that in each step, with probability $\geq \frac{1}{3}$ the assignment $\alpha$ goes one step closer to $\astar$ and with probability $\leq \frac{2}{3}$ it goes one step further from $\astar$. $q_r \geq $ the probability that the random walk starting at position $r$ reaches position $0$ within $3n$ steps.
